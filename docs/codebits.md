## Abstract

A site to post code snippets or even whole modules where people can
annotate directly on the code. The general idea is that instead of
direct code questions users will give constructive feed back on actual
code including style, use of good idioms or where some one is engaging
in anti-patterns.

## tech to use

  - use material ui
  - find a popup that I like

## MVP (minimum viable project)

  - paste code
  - display code with syntax highlighting
  - annotate code with annotations showing up on the code itself
  - brows code snippets or modules by language tags or skill
  - provide easy ways to link to docs

## Extra

  - auto complete in comments and annotations
  - other annotation tools
  - annotation voting
  - add user auth

## Difficulty's

  - I suck at design
  - I have no idea how annotations should be displayed

## Story's

  - Dev story
      - use scrum
      - setup Travis ci
      - set up linting
      - scaffold up a new react app
      - add to github including passing Travis

<!-- end list -->

  - User story
      - add more detail to user story's
          - use a real narrative

<!-- end list -->

  - paste code user gose to the web site and pastes a code snip, which
    brings them to the display page.

<!-- end list -->

  - add annotation user goes to display page for a given snippet and
    clicks the button to annotate the code snip. a text box opens up
    allowing the user to write code with a few tools to help with
    writing.

<!-- end list -->

  - view all snips User goes the list page and sees all snips in order.
    the user can filter by skill or lang. User can click on a snip and
    is brought to the display page.
